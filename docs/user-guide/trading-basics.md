4. **Executes Trades** on Aster DEX automatically
5. **Monitors Performance** and adjusts

```
Market Data → Technical Analysis → AI Decision → Risk Check → Execute → Monitor
     ↑                                                                      ↓
     └──────────────────────── Continuous Loop ─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Components

**AI Models**: 6 LLM options (DeepSeek, Qwen, Claude, Grok, Gemini, GPT)  
**Trading Pairs**: BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE, XRP (all vs USDT)  
**Trade Types**: Long (buy) and Short (sell) positions  
**Leverage**: 1-10x (configurable)  
**Risk System**: 4-layer protection

## 🤖 Understanding Decisions

### Decision Types

**1. OPEN LONG**
```json
{
  "action": "open_long",
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "quantity": 0.001,
  "leverage": 10,
  "reason": "Strong bullish momentum with RSI oversold bounce"
}
```
- **Meaning**: Buy/go long on the asset
- **Profit when**: Price goes up
- **Risk**: Price goes down

**2. OPEN SHORT**
```json
{
  "action": "open_short",
  "symbol": "ETHUSDT",
  "quantity": 0.01,
  "leverage": 10,
  "reason": "Bearish trend with resistance rejection"
}
```
- **Meaning**: Sell/go short on the asset
- **Profit when**: Price goes down
- **Risk**: Price goes up

**3. CLOSE**
```json
{
  "action": "close",
  "symbol": "SOLUSDT",
  "side": "long",
  "reason": "Take profit target reached at +10%"
}
```
- **Meaning**: Close an existing position
- **Why**: Take profit, cut losses, or reduce exposure

**4. WAIT**
```json
{
  "action": "wait",
  "reason": "No high-confidence setups; market conditions unclear"
}
```
- **Meaning**: Do nothing this cycle
- **Why**: No good opportunities, or risk limits reached

### AI Reasoning Examples

**Bullish Decision**:
```
"BTC showing strong momentum: Price broke above $68,000 resistance with high 
volume. RSI(7) at 75.3 indicates overbought but trend is strong. MACD positive 
and histogram expanding. 4h trend +3.2%. Opening long with tight 3% stop loss 
at $65,960. Risk/reward 1:3.3 (excellent). Using 30% of available balance at 
10x leverage for $300 position size."
```

**Bearish Decision**:
```
"ETH rejecting resistance at $3,900 for third time. RSI(14) at 72.5 (overbought). 
MACD showing bearish divergence. 4h downtrend -2.1%. Opening short position 
targeting $3,700 support (-5.1%). Stop loss at $3,950 (+1.3%). Risk/reward 1:4."
```

**Wait Decision**:
```
"Market conditions unclear across all pairs. BTC neutral RSI, mixed MACD signals. 
ETH in consolidation range. SOL low volume. With limited $7.50 available balance 
and existing BNB position, waiting for clearer setups. Patience preferred over 
forced trades."
```

With existing positions: Max 30% of available balance
```
*Prevents over-concentration in single trade*

**Layer 2: Total Position Limits**
```
All positions combined: Max 80% of total balance
Reserve: Always keep 20%+ available
```
*Ensures capital reserve for opportunities*

**Layer 3: Per-Position Limits**
```
Position size: Max 30% of account
Stop loss: 3% from entry price
Take profit: 10% from entry price
Max leverage: 10x
```

### Example Scenario

```
Account: $1,000 USDT
Available: $800 (no positions)

✅ Can open: $400 position (50% of available)
❌ Cannot open: $500 position (exceeds limit)

❌ Cannot open: $200 position (exceeds limit)
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Key Metrics Explained

**Win Rate**
```
Win Rate = (Winning Trades / Total Trades) × 100%

Example: 15 wins out of 25 trades = 60% win rate
```
- **Good**: >55%
- **Excellent**: >65%
- **Note**: Quality > quantity

**Profit Factor**
```
Profit Factor = Gross Profit / Absolute Gross Loss

Example: $200 profit, $75 loss = 2.67 profit factor
```
- **Break even**: 1.0
- **Good**: >1.5
- **Excellent**: >2.0
- **Meaning**: How much you make per dollar lost

**Sharpe Ratio**
```
Sharpe Ratio = (Average Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Std Dev

Example: Sharpe of 1.85 means good risk-adjusted returns
```
- **Good**: >1.0
- **Very Good**: >2.0
- **Excellent**: >3.0
- **Meaning**: Return per unit of risk

**Max Drawdown**
```
Max Drawdown = Largest peak-to-trough decline

Example: Peak $1,100 → Trough $1,000 = -$100 (-9.1%)
```
- **Good**: <10%
- **Acceptable**: <15%
- **Warning**: >20%
- **Meaning**: Worst-case loss from peak

## 🎯 Trading Strategies

### How AI Chooses Trades

**Bullish Signals**:
- Price above EMA (uptrend)
- RSI < 30 (oversold, potential bounce)
- MACD > Signal (bullish momentum)
- Histogram increasing (momentum accelerating)
- Volume increasing

**Bearish Signals**:
- Price below EMA (downtrend)
- RSI > 70 (overbought, potential reversal)
- MACD < Signal (bearish momentum)
- Histogram decreasing (momentum fading)
- Rejection at resistance

**Risk/Reward**:
- Minimum 1:2 ratio (risk $1 to make $2)
- Typical: 1:3 to 1:4
- Stop loss: 3% from entry
- Take profit: 10% from entry

### Trading Philosophy

**Conservative Approach**:
- Wait for high-confidence setups
- Skip questionable opportunities
- Preserve capital > chase gains
- Quality trades > quantity

**Position Sizing**:
- Smaller account (<$100): Focus on cheaper coins (DOGE, XRP)
- Larger account (>$1000): Can trade all pairs
- Scale position size with account growth
